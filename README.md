**PyForth** is a practice project, aiming to implement a (partial) Forth(ish)
interpreter in Python. It has no known useful reason for existing beyond giving
me a chance to exercise my rusty Python. It's also incomplete to the point of
probably being a fourth of a fourth of Forth.

With that said, if you think it might be useful to you, go ahead and grab a
copy and do something with it. It's free, it's open, it's cool.
